# Run Monitoring — outbound crash alerting

Spec: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-31-remote-crash-alerting-design.md`

Each sweep machine pings healthchecks.io every 5 min; the service alarms on silence
and pushes to the phone. No VPN, no SSH, no Claude session involved.

- `measure_log_gaps.py` — derives the progress grace window from a real batch log.
  Test: `python -m pytest test_measure_log_gaps.py`.
  **Measured 2026-07-31 against `stepB_weekend_batch.log` (10 runs): largest legitimate
  quiet gap 81 s; grace set to 3600 s.**
- `heartbeat.ps1` — the heartbeat. Test: `powershell -File Test-Heartbeat.ps1`.
- `install_heartbeat_task.ps1` — creates the SYSTEM Scheduled Task (idempotent).
- `hc-config.template.json` — copy to `<toolsdir>\hc-config.json` and fill in the UUIDs.
  **The real config never enters git; this repo is public and ping URLs are capability URLs.**
- `resume_sweep.ps1` / `install_resume_task.ps1` — Part B, boot-triggered auto-resume.
  Test: `powershell -File Test-ResumeSweep.ps1`.
